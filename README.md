# Basic Discord Bot Boilerplate
This is a discord bot. 

## Prefix
Use '*' to send commands to the bot. For example, *ping would send a command called ping to the bot. The server would reply with 'pong'

# Setting up.
git clone this repo. 
run npm install
Create a .env file and add your bot's TOKEN there.
Run index.js
The bot should connect. 

# Implementing specific functions
If you want to implement custom commands add them in the commands folder with the name of the file as the command that you wish to run.
