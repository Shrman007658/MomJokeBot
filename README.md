# Basic Discord Bot Boilerplate
This is a discord bot. 

## Prefix
Use '*' to send commands to the bot. For example, *ping would send a command called ping to the bot. The server would reply with 'pong'

# Setting up.
git clone this repo. 
run npm install
Create a .env file and add your bot's TOKEN there.
Run index.js
The bot should connect. 

Think you can help the bot get better? Get your commits in and we will see! 
You think you have far more mom jokes in your head than there should be? Update them in the jokes.json and se your jokes transmit to the world!


# Implementing specific functions
If you want to implement custom commands add them in the commands folder with the name of the file as the command that you wish to run.
